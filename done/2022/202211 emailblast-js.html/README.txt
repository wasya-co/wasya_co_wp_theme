Events (t=event): Email opens should be tracked as events. Here t=event tells GA that this is a hitType event.
Event Category (&ec) represents a category. If you set email as a category, it tells Google Analytics that the event is “emails.”
Client ID (&cid): Client ID is a tracking ID you can assign to recipients. If you want to keep the Client ID anonymous, use 555 as a value here.
Event Action (&ea) represents an event action such as “email open.”
Document Title (&dt) represents the subject line of the email.
Document Path (&dp) specifies the path of the tracked item.
Event Label (&el) Event labels allow you to assign a unique ID to the recipient of the email so that it can be recognized.
